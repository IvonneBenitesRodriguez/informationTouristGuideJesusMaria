Hi there 👋

My name is Ivonne and I created an information Tourist Guide for my District in Peru named Jesus Maria.
---
#Project's name :  _Information Tourist Guide for a District_.

##Type of the project:  _a website_.

###Customers:  _International students_ 👩🏽‍🎓🧑🏼‍🎓

##Description:   
This is a _Information Tourist Guide for international students who will visit for 1st time Peru_.
It has the basic and important information to make of their stay the most pleasant and safe possible.
As students usually stay from 4 months till 1 year. I consider having this summarized information is worth it to them.
I've included advises about safety, weather, vaccines, currency, nearest hospitals ,nearest markets between other important topics 📍.
The student can read it in a mobile device 📲, ipad, and laptop.👩🏽‍💻
🗾 The maps provided in the information have a **zoom option**.

## 🚀Technologies used: 
I have used a **free Bootstrap template** and I have modified it and added more pages to this template since the template was at first just a landing page.
I have used **HTML, CSS and Media Queries** to add responsiveness to this project.
