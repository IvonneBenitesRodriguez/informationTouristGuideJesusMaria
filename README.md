Hi there 👋

My name is Ivonne and I created an information Tourist Guide for my District in Peru named Jesus Maria.

## Project's name :  Information Tourist Guide for a District.

## Type of the project: &nbsp; a website.

### Customers: &nbsp; International students 👩🏽‍🎓🧑🏼‍🎓

## Description:   
This is a _Information Tourist Guide for international students who will visit for 1st time Peru_.<br/>
It has the basic and important information to make of their stay the most pleasant and safe possible.<br/>
As students usually stay from 4 months till 1 year. I consider having this summarized information is worth it to them.<br/>
I've included advises about safety, weather, vaccines, currency, nearest hospitals ,nearest markets between other important topics 📍.<br/>
The student can read it in a mobile device &nbsp; **📲, &nbsp; ipad, and &nbsp; laptop👩🏽‍💻.**
<br/>
🗾 The maps provided in the information have a **zoom option**.

## 🚀Technologies used: 
I have used a **free Bootstrap template** and I have modified it and added more pages to this template since the template was at first just a landing page.
I have used **HTML, CSS and Media Queries** to add responsiveness to this project.
At first I used **Netlify** to deploy the project. 
I used also **Photoshop** to edit photographs and create images for this project.
